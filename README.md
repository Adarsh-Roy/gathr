# gthr

A CLI tool for directory text ingestion, similar to gitingest web app,
with interactive fuzzy finder capabilities with the ability to interactively choose
what to include or exclude using a modern terminal user interface.

## Features

- **Smart Output**: Markdown output with syntax highlighting. Automatically copies to clipboard when you export. Optionally, saves to a file.
- **Interactive Fuzzy Finder**: Browse and search through files with a responsive TUI
- **Hierarchical Selection**: Including/excluding directories affects all children
- **Color-coded Feedback**:
  - üü¢ Green: Included files/directories
  - üî¥ Red: Excluded files/directories
  - üü° Yellow: Partially included (mixed children states)
- **Multiple Modes**: Pre-include everything or start with everything excluded
- **Smart File Detection**: Automatically identifies text files vs binary files
- **Configurable**: Set max file size limit (default 1 MB), ignore or respect `.gitignore`
- **Vim-like Controls**: Vim-like navigation support (`Ctrl+J`/`Ctrl-K`) alongside arrow keys

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
# Add the tap and install
brew tap adarsh-roy/gthr
brew install gthr
```

Or install directly:

```bash
brew install adarsh-roy/gthr/gthr
```

### Build From Source

**NOTE**: You must have `cargo` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-Roy/gthr.git
cd gthr
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/gthr`. To install it in a directory you can run:

```bash
install -m 755 ./target/release/gthr /path/to/bin
```

Make sure that `/path/to/bin` is in your `$PATH` environment variable.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

By default, `gthr` runs in _Interactive Mode_.

```bash
# Start interactive mode in current directory
gthr

# Start with all files pre-included
gthr --include-all

# Start with all files excluded (pick what to include, ths is the default)
gthr --exclude-all

# Specify a different root directory
gthr -r /path/to/directory

# Save output to a file (it copies to clipboard regardless)
gthr -o output.md
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# Generate output immediately with current settings
gthr --non-interactive --include-all -o output.md

# Process specific directory
gthr --non-interactive --include-all -r /path/to/project -o project_ingest.md
```

### Direct Mode

> [!WARNING]
> This is a WIP.

```bash
# Use include/exclude patterns (TODO: Not implemented yet)
gthr direct --include "*.rs" --exclude "target/*"
```

## Interactive Controls

Simple and intuitive - no modes to worry about!

### Search
- `Type any character` - Directly adds to search (letters, numbers, symbols)
- `Backspace` - Delete search character
- `Esc` - Clear search text (or quit if search is empty)

### Navigation
- `‚Üë/‚Üì` - Move up/down through files
- `‚Üê/‚Üí` - Alternative up/down navigation
- `Ctrl+J/Ctrl+K` - Vim-like up/down navigation
- `Page Up/Page Down` - Page navigation
- `Home/End` - Go to top/bottom

### Selection
- `Enter` - Toggle selection of current item (‚úì/‚úó)

### Actions
- `Ctrl+E` - Export output and quit
- `Ctrl+H` - Show help
- `Esc` - Clear search (or quit if search is empty)

### Output Behavior
- **Default**: Copies output to clipboard (up to 1MB)
- **Large files**: Prompts for filename if output exceeds 1MB
- **Manual save**: Use `-o filename.md` to save directly to file

## Command Line Options

```
Options:
  -r, --root <ROOT>                    Root directory to process [default: .]
  -i, --include-all                    Pre-include all files and directories
  -e, --exclude-all                    Pre-exclude all files and directories
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>                Output file path
      --non-interactive                Skip interactive mode and use current selection
      --max-file-size <MAX_FILE_SIZE>  Maximum file size to include (in bytes) [default: 1048576]
```

## Advanced Usage

```bash
# Exclude large files (limit to 512KB)
gthr --max-file-size 524288

# Quick non-interactive export
gthr --non-interactive --include-all
```

## Similar Tools and Differences

- [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/) - Web-based git repository ingestion (awesome website). It has a cli version as well.
    - It doesn't have interactive include/exclude with fuzzy matching.
    - The digest is either printed to stdout or saved in a file, there's no "copy to clipboard and paste right away" option.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Configuration file support (`.gthrrc`)
- [ ] Custom include/exclude patterns (glob support, regex support in the search area)
- [ ] Multiple output formats (JSON, plain text)
- [ ] Preset configurations for different project types
- [ ] Performance optimizations for huge directories
